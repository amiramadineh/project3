# CSC463-Socket-Programming

This project aims to teach you how to build a simple centralized file sharing system using socket programming. In this project, you need to learn the design principle of centralized file sharing system and complete the program provided by instructor . Detailed instructions will be provided in class lectures. The source codes are available on BlackBoard.

## Requirements

- Use your cluster built in project 2 to hold your file server.
- Add the following functionalities to the server:
    1. Client can upload files to the server.

- **Bonus:** You server can support multiple clients at the same time. 

Please feel free to make any necessary modifications to the original source code to support your additional functionalities. You can also rewrite the whole program if you have preferred programming language  other than Python.

- You need to submit a report, the report should include following sections:
    1. Introduction
    2. Design and Implementation of your file sharing system (protocols, communication logic, class diagrams and etc.)
    3. Test: test all the functionalities of your system with screenshots
    4. User manual: detailed instruction on how to use the system.

## Deliverables:

You need to submit an IEEE format report on BlackBoard

You need to submit all the source code to GitHub

## Grading
- Report format (**10%**)
- Design and Implementation  (**60%**)
- Test  (**20%**)
- User manual (**10%**)
